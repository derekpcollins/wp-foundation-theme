# WordPress Foundation Theme

An extremely minimalist WordPress theme intended as a foundation for theme developers.

## Overview

I hesitate to even call this a "theme" as it is really just a set of files to serve as the basis for creating new themes from scratch.

It is intentionally minimalist and I tried to make very few assumptions about what a developer/designer might want. There are no included styles and there's very little in the way of HTML structure. I wanted to leave as much as I could up to the discretion of the theme developer/designer.
